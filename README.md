# Function Generator
A Compact Cost Effective Function Generator based on 8051.

During modern times wireless digital communication plays a major role in everyone life. For digital communication between two devices, we use pulse signal and for wireless medium communication we modulate pulse signal to sinusoidal wave. For testing various system, there is a need of various type of waveform. Therefore, there is a need of the device which come in handy to perform all these operation with much ease and it is also affordable. The proposed device can generate a pulse wave, sinusoidal wave, ramp signal and Amplitude modulation signal frequency can be varied using buttons. An LCD 16 x 2 display will confirm the type of signal at output.
